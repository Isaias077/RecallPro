/**
 * Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit.
 * They are relatively simple combinations of UI elements that work together.
 * 
 * This directory contains molecular components that are:
 * - Composed of multiple atoms
 * - Focused on a single responsibility
 * - Reusable across the application
 * 
 * Examples include:
 * - Form fields (label + input + error message)
 * - Search bars (input + button)
 * - Card headers (title + subtitle + icon)
 * - Alert messages (icon + message + action)
