# Atomic Design Structure

This project follows the Atomic Design methodology, which breaks down components into five distinct levels:

## 1. Atoms

Atoms are the smallest possible components, such as buttons, inputs, or text labels. They serve as the foundational building blocks of our interface.

- Examples: Button, TextField, Typography, Icon

## 2. Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit. They are relatively simple combinations of UI elements that work together.

- Examples: SearchBar (input + button), FormField (label + input + error message)

## 3. Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. They form distinct sections of the interface.

- Examples: Navigation, LoginForm, FlashcardItem

## 4. Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.

- Examples: DashboardTemplate, StudySessionTemplate

## 5. Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.

- Examples: DashboardPage, LoginPage, FlashcardManagerPage

## Implementation Notes

- Each component should be focused on a single responsibility
- Higher-level components (organisms, templates, pages) should compose lower-level components
- Maintain consistent props and styling patterns across components
- Use Material UI components as atoms when possible instead of recreating them
