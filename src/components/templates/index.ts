/**
 * Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate
 * the design's underlying content structure.
 * 
 * This directory contains template components that are:
 * - Composed of organisms, molecules, and atoms
 * - Define the layout and structure of a page
 * - Focus on the arrangement of components rather than specific content
 * - Reusable across similar pages
 * 
 * Examples include:
 * - DashboardTemplate
 * - StudySessionTemplate
 * - AuthTemplate (for login/signup pages)
 * - FlashcardManagerTemplate
